This my morning alarm clock. Design question here is not how it looks like, or how it sounds like. The question is what do you want to hear in the morning in your bed. Currently it gathers and reads the following:
* Greetings
* Time and date
* Calendar events
* To-do list
* Weather conditions
* Unread email count and VIP email count
* Location of tracked packages
* News headlines
* Daily quotations

For obvious reasons it is called Jarvis.
